# frame-aligner-verification
A Verilog/SystemVerilog project implementing a Frame Aligner module. The module monitors an incoming data stream for specific header patterns (0xAFAA or 0xBA55), detects alignment based on consecutive matches, and signals misalignment when headers are missing. Includes verification testbench and coverage analysis.
